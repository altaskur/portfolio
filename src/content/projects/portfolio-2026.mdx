## The Problem
Existing portfolio themes were too bloated and didn't reflect the "Dark Systems" aesthetic I identify with. I needed a site that was fast, accessible, and easy to maintain.

## Technical Decisions
- **Astro**: For zero-JS by default and island architecture.
- **Tailwind v4**: For the latest CSS features and compile-time performance.
- **GSAP**: For complex, timeline-based animations.

## Trade-offs
Using a "minimal" template meant building everything from scratch, but it gave me full control over the DOM size and performance metrics.
