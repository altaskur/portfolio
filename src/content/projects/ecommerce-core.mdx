## The Problem
The legacy monolith was suffering from tight coupling and slow deployment cycles during Black Friday traffic spikes.

## Technical Decisions
- **Go**: For high concurrency and low memory footprint.
- **gRPC**: For efficient inter-service communication.
- **Event Sourcing**: To ensure data consistency across services.

## Trade-offs
Complexity increased significantly in terms of observability and distributed tracing, requiring a robust monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana).
